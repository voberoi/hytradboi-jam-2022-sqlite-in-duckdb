// The plan: create a SQLite DuckDB column type and play around with it.
//
// - Store SQLite dbs in DuckDB blobs.
// - Provide functions to query these blobs.
// - Play around with a few use cases and analyze them.
// - Maybe provide other utility functions as I discove rthem.
//
// Currently need to:
//
// 1. Figure out how to write a simple DuckDB extension.
// 2. Figure out how to write this simple DuckDB extension in Rust.

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
